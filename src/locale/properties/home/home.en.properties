ngOrcid.orcidProvides=ORCID provides a persistent digital identifier (an ORCID iD) that you own and control, and that distinguishes you from every other researcher. You can connect your iD with your professional information — affiliations, grants, publications, peer review, and more. You can use your iD to share your information with other systems, ensuring you get recognition for all your contributions, saving you time and hassle, and reducing the risk of errors.
ngOrcid.enhanceYourProfile=The more information connected to your ORCID record, the more you’ll benefit from sharing your iD - so give the organizations you trust permission to update your record as well as adding your affiliations, emails, other names you’re known by, and more.
ngOrcid.includeYourId=Use your iD, when prompted, in systems and platforms from grant application to manuscript submission and beyond, to ensure you get credit for your contributions.
ngOrcid.orcidIs=ORCID is a non-profit organization supported by a global community of member organizations, including research institutions, publishers, funders, professional associations, service providers, and other stakeholders in the research ecosystem.
