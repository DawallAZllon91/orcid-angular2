<h1>Developer tools</h1>
<p>
  This section is intended for developers who plan to integrate ORCID into their
  system using the ORCID Public API.
</p>

<h2>Getting started with the free ORCID Public API</h2>

<p>
  ORCID offers an API (Application Programming Interface) that allows your
  systems and applications to connect to the ORCID registry via
  machine-to-machine communication. Using the Public API, your system or
  application can:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Allow users to sign into your system/application with their ORCID username
    and password
  </li>
  <li>Get a user's authenticated ORCID iD</li>
  <li>Retrieve a machine-readable version of a user's public ORCID record</li>
  <li>Perform a machine-generated search of the ORCID registry</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The ORCID API is RESTful and uses OAuth 2.0, a well-established, standard
  protocol for user-based permissions.
</p>
<p>
  Public Client Applications are granted to individuals and not organizations,
  and your Public Client is personal to you (even if you are using it in
  connection with your work for an organization).
</p>

<h2>ORCID Public Client Terms of Service</h2>
DIVIDER HERE

<p>
  The ORCID Public API allows you to request permission to receive an
  authenticated ORCID iD, to read public information from an ORCID record and to
  search public data on the ORCID registry according to the conditions stated in
  the Public Client Terms of Service.
