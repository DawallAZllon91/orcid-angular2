## Fonts

The following list of typography definitions available on the applications
Those can be simply used as classes on any HTML element.

<Story id="foundation-fonts--noto-sans" height="830px" />

For instance

```
<h1 class="mat-display-1">
  LATEST NEWS
</h1>
```

## ðŸ”§Adding/overwriting fonts

To modified any of the typographies the file `src/assets/scss/material.typography.scss` can be updated.
And if a new typography is required it's map `orcid-custom-typography` can be extended.

#### Importing more fonts

Currently, only some NotoSans fonts files are declared on the application CSS.
If a new weight or style of NotoSans is needed the file `src/assets/scss/noto-sans.scss`
has the `notosans-fontface` mixin that can be included to add any of the available fonts on
`src/assets/fonts/noto-sans`.

For instance

Add a new font file to the CSS to support italics on 400 weight fonts

```

// added to `src/assets/fonts/noto-sans`
@include notosans-fontface('Thin', 400, italic);
```
