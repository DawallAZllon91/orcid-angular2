# Internationalization

There are are two types of translation the ones that are located in the HTML of the components (static translations) and the ones that must exist in the TS code of the components (dynamic translations). Both are handled slightly different in the application.

## Static translations:

For any HTML tag that contains text only like the following

```
<button>MORE NEWS</button>

```

A translation tag can be added

```
<button i18n="@@home.more_news">MORE NEWS</button>
```

On build time this is going to change the contained text for the value of the matching translation key `home.more_news` for all the languages on the Orcid Source properties files `https://github.com/ORCID/ORCID-Source/tree/master/orcid-core/src/main/resources/i18n`

## Dynamic translations

Angular does not directly support dynamic translations, because of that first a static translation must be created inside the `/src/locale/i18n.pseudo.component.html` component, for instance, add

```
<var i18n="@@home.more_news">MORE NEWS</var>
```

Build the translations running

```
npm run build:i18n
```

Now the new translation is available on the `\src\locale\messages.dynamic.en.ts` file, so it can be used inside the components

```
import { LOCALE } from '../../../locale/messages.dynamic.en'
....
let text= LOCALE['home.more_news']
```

On build time this translation file is going to be changed for each language.
