# Internationalization

There are are two types of translation the ones that are located in the HTML of the components (static translations) and the ones that must exist in the TypeScript code of the components (dynamic translations). Both are handled slightly different in the application.

## Static translations:

For any HTML tag that contains text only like the following

```
<button>MORE NEWS</button>

```

A translation tag can be added

```
<button i18n="@@home.more_news">MORE NEWS</button>
```

On build time this is going to change the contained text for the value of the matching translation key `home.more_news` for all the languages on the [Orcid Source translations files.](https://github.com/ORCID/ORCID-Source/tree/master/orcid-core/src/main/resources/i18n), and the HTML value itself is going to be overwritten meaning all the translation processing required is executed only during compilation.

## Dynamic translations

Generally is better to avoid the use of dynamic translations, since static translations are very efficient. But sometimes some scenarios require more flexibility and the text content must exist inside the component scripting.

To make this possible first a static translation must be created inside the file `/src/locale/i18n.pseudo.component.html`

For instance, add the following line

```
<var i18n="@@home.more_news">MORE NEWS</var>
```

Build the translations

```
npm run build:i18n
```

And now the new translation is available on the `\src\locale\messages.dynamic.en.ts` file, so it can be used inside the TS code

```

import { LOCALE } from '../../../locale/messages.dynamic.en'
....
let text= LOCALE['home.more_news']

```

On build time this imported translation file is going to be automatically swapped for each language.

## Applying modification on build time

Is possible to apply modifications to the text on compilation time.
For instance, adding the key `#upperCase` before the translation key

```
<button i18n="#upperCase@@helloWorld">Hello!</button>
```

Will transform the translated text on every language to uppercase before using it to build the application.

The following transformations keys are available

| Key           | Initial text  | Processed text |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| #upperCase    | test          | TEST           |
| #lowerCase    | TEST          | test           |
| #titleCase    | test tile     | Test Tile      |
| #sentenceCase | test sentence | Test sentence  |

If more preprocessing methods are required those can be added on the function `translationTreatment` on `/src/locale/translate-file-generator.ts`

## Debugging translations

To find possible problems on translations the file `src\locale\messages.translation.log.json` is generated on compilation time, or by just running `npm run build:i18n`. It contains a list of objects for every supported i18n codes, each with the following parameters:

| Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| notFound        | A list of unexisting translation IDs on the properties files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| unexistingFiles | A list of unexisting file URLs on [Orcid Source repo](https://github.com/ORCID/ORCID-Source/tree/master/orcid-core/src/main/resources/i18n) that were expected for the language.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| changed         | A list of objects that represent the translations that were altered through the script. Each contains the translation `id`, the original `translation` on the properties files, and the `replacement` that the script sets.                                                                                                                                  |
| unmatch         | This parameter can only be present on the English language `en`, it shows which translations do not match between the templates and the English properties files. Each contains the `id` of the translation, `textOnTemplate` and `textOnProperty` This is the best way to find translation keys which value don't match the expected value on the template. |

## Testing translations locally

To test translations it is require to serve the application with AOT compilation. For this is possible to directly call any of the local configuration for the supported languages.

For instance, to test french serve the application with the language configuration `ng serve --configuration=local-fr`.

// TODO Ones we have established the best way to run the app locally this should be updated.
